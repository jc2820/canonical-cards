# Canonical Take Home Test

To make a runable project using [Vanilla Framework](https://vanillaframework.io/) to replicate a design of three blog post cards using data from a Wordpress API.
I've used create-react-app as it was the fastest way for me to stand up a runable app with built in Sass/scss support. 

## To run this project

1. Clone this repository and navigate to its root folder.
2. Install node modules with `npm i`
3. run the app with `npm start`. It should open your primary browser on the correct page when the run script completes but if not:
4. visit localhost:3000 in your browser when the run script is successful.

### tests
You can run the tests if you like with `npm test`. They're pretty basic.
